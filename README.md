## Approach
- Started with wireframing and ERB modeling first. 
- Tried to map out and draw up how we wanted the app to function before starting to code. This planning helped make for a clean, quick start that allowed us to get the MVP technical requirements done in 3 days.
- We were able to execute well by working together on the more difficult, general portions of the app, e.g.: routes, server.js file, deploying to heroku, and authentication/authorization. 
- We challenged ourselves by selecting a different API for each team member to integrate onto a single page (SPA). We coded around each other in case one of us got caught up on an issue.  
- The user stories to begin with were:
    * As a user, I want to be able to have my own dashboard to have 1 central place to see latest info on my interests
	* As a user, I want to be able to see who my favorite NFL team is playing this week so I can plan to watch it.
    * As a user, I want to be able to listen to music from my favorite artist while on the same page as looking up my favorite NFL team and actor news.
    * As a user, I want to be able to see info on my favorite actors to stay up to date on their latest news.
